# Assumptions

- Assumes the input file is a Multiple Sequence Alignment file, meaning, all
sequences have the same length.

# Install

Clone this repository and install it with user privileges

```
git clone https://github.com/merlyescalona/gacmsa.git
cd gacmsa
python setup.py instal --user
```

# Usage:
```
usage: gacmsa.py -i <filepath> -o <filepath> [-l <log_level>] [-v] [-h]
```

**Required arguments**:
- `-i <filepath>`, `--input <filepath>`: Multiple-alignment sequence file (MSA).
- `-o <filepath>`, `--output <filepath>`: Output file

**Optional arguments**:
- `-l <log_level>`, `--log <log_level>`: Specified level of log that will be shown through the standard output. Entire log will be stored in a separate file.
    - Values:['DEBUG', 'INFO', 'WARNING', 'ERROR']. Default: `INFO`.

**Information arguments**:
- `-v`, `--version`  : Show program's version number and exit
- `-h`, `--help`: Show this help message and exit

# Input

- a Multiple Sequence alignment file path ([MSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sequence_alignment))

# Output

- Output file (plain text), opened with `cat output.txt | less -S` will give you:

Where:

- Line 1: POSITION corresponds to the base position, and will have as many columns as the length of the given sequences.
- Line 2: **`A`**, corresponds to the count of `A` alleles in `POSITION`, for all the sequences.
- Line 3: **`C`**, corresponds to the count of `C` alleles in `POSITION`, for all the sequences.
- Line 4: **`G`**, corresponds to the count of `G` alleles in `POSITION`, for all the sequences.
- Line 5: **`T`**, corresponds to the count of `T` alleles in `POSITION`, for all the sequences.
- Line 6: **`N`**, corresponds to the count of `N`s in `POSITION`, for all the sequences.
- Line 7: **`GAP`**, corresponds to the count of `GAPs` (`-`) in `POSITION`, for all the sequences.
- Line 8: **`TOTAL`**, corresponds to the number of alleles for the specific `POSITION`.
- Line 9: gives the number of sequences and the size of the sequences in the given file. Format: `NumberOfSequences   (LengthOfSequence)`
